## Game Modifications
* Powerups that include; (All powerups last for 10 seconds, they also randomly appear and disappear after a set time if no one hits it)
    * Making a paddel bigger (opponent or player, this depends on who hit the powerup)
    * Making a paddel smaller (opponent or player, this depends on who hit the powerup)
    * Increasing the speed of the ball

* Double tap to dash

## Reasonings
* Powerups allow the player to beat the opponent by introducing a different aspect of challenge to the game. By shrinking or increasing the size of the paddel creates a different type of challenge and makes it more difficult for the player to hit the ball. As well, increasing the speed of the ball for a set duration introduces different physics and makes the game more challenging. 

* The dash allows the player to keep up with some of the powerups by adding extra speed to the player paddle
