## Game Features
* The game features a main menu. A key aspect to the menu is that the highlighted option blinks to give the old-school retro effect. Once the game is finished or the player dies the main menu is displayed again shortly after the "Game Over" screen is displayed (3 seconds). Each level adds a new player image, new blaster sound, new background image and music and new bullet image.
* Note: After each level is finished a corresponding info screen is shown. You can proceed to the next level by pressing Enter.
* Level 1: 
* - Enemies: Standard Alien that ends the game by reaching near the bottom of the screen
* Level 2:
* - Adds an obstacle: the meteor which ends the game by hitting you, does not end the game
*   when it reaches bottom of screen
* Level 3:
* - Adds a new harder enemy which ends the game by reaching near the bottom of the screen
* Level 4:
* - Adds a new enemy with different ai that tracks the player and tries to collide with you. 
* - This enemy only ends the game by colliding with you, not by reaching the bottom of the screen
*   allowing you to dodge
## Known Bugs
* A rare bug can sometimes happen when the game over screen is reached and you go replay the game again, a level
* can immediately show the game over screen. If this happens just close the game and run it again.
