## Game Features
* The game features a main menu. A key aspect to the menu is that the highlighted option blinks to give the old-school retro effect. Once the game is finished or the player dies the main menu is displayed again shortly after the "Game Over" screen is displayed (3 seconds).
* Note: After each level is finished a corresponding info screen is shown. You can proceed to the next level by pressing Enter.
* Level 1: 
* - Enemies: Standard Alien that ends the game by reaching near the bottom of the screen
* Level 2:
* - Adds an obstacle: the meteor which ends the game by hitting you, does not end the game
*   when it reaches bottom of screen
* Level 3:
* - Adds a new harder enemy which ends the game by reaching near the bottom of the screen
* Level 4:
* - Adds a new enemy with different ai that tracks the player and tries to collide with you. 
* - This enemy only ends the game by colliding with you, not by reaching the bottom of the screen
*   allowing you to dodge
## Known Bugs
* A rare bug can sometimes happen when the game over screen is reached and you go replay the game again, a level
* can immediately show the game over screen. If this happens just close the game and run it again.
